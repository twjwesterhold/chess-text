## Chess-Text

This is a React app intended to extract text from images and provide a usable chess board
for any sequences of chess moves found in the text.

Right now, it's practice with TypeScript and React (building an interactive board), and
once the interactive board is complete development will begin on text-from-image extraction.

Ultimately, the plan is to develop this into an app so chess players can easily scan through
reference books for significantly quicker studying.

## To Run

Clone repository locally, install packages with `npm i` then run project with `npm run dev`. It's
that simple! Enjoy!
